# LeanFrontier contribution directions

This document is a durable planning aid for `qazW12345/LeanFrontier`.

It is **not** part of the trusted LeanFrontier submission contract and it does **not** authorize opening an upstream PR by itself. Before acting on any direction below, re-read current upstream rules, re-fetch live `main`, inspect the accepted source modules, search Mathlib and LeanFrontier for duplicates/equivalent formulations, and revalidate the mathematical literature claim.

The purpose of this file is narrower: preserve the best currently audited directions for making the LeanFrontier corpus accumulate into connected, reusable bodies of mathematics rather than a bag of unrelated theorems.

## 1. Selection principle

Prefer a bridge theorem when it does all or most of the following:

- substantively uses two or more accepted LeanFrontier definitions/theorems, rather than merely importing their modules;
- expresses a recognized mathematical connection, or creates an abstraction with clear independent purpose;
- has plausible downstream consumers after it is merged;
- strengthens the internal dependency graph for mathematical reasons rather than for graph aesthetics;
- is not already present in Mathlib or LeanFrontier under an equivalent formulation;
- survives an adversarial boundary review before a candidate is frozen.

A useful test is:

> If this bridge existed, what mathematically natural theorem would become easier or newly possible next?

If there is no good answer, do not formalize the bridge merely to create an import edge.

## 2. Current high-value mathematical clusters

The accepted corpus currently contains several mathematically related groups whose formal dependency structure is much weaker than their mathematical relationship.

### Rational / Farey / Stern / Ford / Apollonian cluster

Accepted material includes:

- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.Mediant`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.Farey`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.FordCircle`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.SternDiatomic`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.SternDiatomic.Enumeration`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.DescartesCircle`
- `LeanFrontier.Geometry.InversiveGeometry`

Pending work may add:

- upstream PR #180: geometric Ford-circle tangency in Mathlib `EuclideanGeometry.Sphere` language.

This is presently the most promising synthesis cluster.

### Fibonacci / Lucas / recurrence / matrix cluster

Accepted material includes:

- `LeanFrontier.Combinatorics.FibonacciComposition`
- `LeanFrontier.Analysis.FibonacciReciprocal`
- `LeanFrontier.LinearAlgebra.FibonacciMatrix`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.LucasNumber`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.HoradamSequence`
- nearby higher-order recurrence modules `Padovan` and `Tribonacci`.

This cluster is mathematically dense but formally almost disconnected.

### Markov / rational-tree cluster

Accepted material includes:

- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.MarkovEquation`
- the Farey / Stern material above.

Pending work may add:

- upstream PR #179: ordered positive Markov-tree descent.

A full Markov/Farey correspondence is a high-value long-term target, but it is dependency-gated by missing tree/path infrastructure and must avoid crossing the Markov uniqueness conjecture boundary.

## 3. Audited directions — highest priority

### A. Largest Ford circle between Farey neighbours

**Status:** READY TO INVESTIGATE on accepted `main`.

**Primary parents:**

- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.Farey`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.FordCircle`
- optionally `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.Mediant` for the explicit mediant witness.

**Mathematical target:**

For positive-denominator Farey neighbours `a/b < c/d`, any fraction `p/q` strictly between them satisfies `q >= b + d`. Since a Ford-circle radius is `1 / (2*q^2)`, the Ford circle of the mediant `(a+c)/(b+d)` is the unique largest Ford circle whose rational tangency point lies strictly between the two neighbours.

A strong statement should include the equality/uniqueness case, not merely a monotone radius inequality:

- every interior fraction gives radius at most `radius (b+d)`;
- equality forces `q = b+d` and then `p = a+c` by the accepted Farey equality theorem.

**Why this is valuable:**

This composes arithmetic denominator optimality with Ford geometry. Both accepted parents do essential work. It turns the classical phrase “the mediant is the simplest fraction in the gap” into the geometric statement “the mediant Ford circle is the largest Ford circle in the gap.”

**Adversarial checks required:**

- positivity assumptions on all denominators;
- representation issue: fractions are numerator/denominator pairs, not quotient types;
- equality of radii must imply equality of positive denominators, not only equality of squares;
- ensure reducible/non-reduced alternate representatives do not break the intended uniqueness statement;
- search Mathlib and current LeanFrontier for an equivalent Ford-gap extremal theorem.

**Current priority:** A+.

### B. Ford–Farey–Descartes configuration

**Status:** PROMISING, but the strongest geometric version should wait for upstream PR #180 to merge.

**Primary parents:**

- `Mediant`
- `FordCircle`
- `DescartesCircle`
- preferably the geometric `FordCircleTangency` bridge from PR #180 once accepted.

**Mathematical target:**

For a positive-denominator Farey-neighbour pair, the two parent Ford circles and the Ford circle of their mediant are pairwise externally tangent. Their curvatures are `2*b^2`, `2*d^2`, and `2*(b+d)^2`; together with curvature `0` for the tangent line, these form a Descartes quadruple.

**Important audit result:**

Do **not** submit only the bare identity

`DescartesCircle.IsQuadruple 0 (2*b^2) (2*d^2) (2*(b+d)^2)`.

That algebraic identity is true without the Farey-neighbour hypothesis and would barely compose the existing theories. The worthwhile theorem must include the actual Farey/Ford geometric configuration, with tangency or an equivalent meaningful geometric interface.

**Why this is valuable:**

It connects rational approximation / Stern–Brocot insertion to Apollonian circle geometry and gives `DescartesCircle` a first genuine geometric interpretation.

**Dependency:** merge/acceptance of PR #180 strongly preferred.

**Current priority:** A+ after #180; weak algebra-only formulation should be rejected.

---

### C. Lucas numbers as characteristic-polynomial data of Fibonacci Q-matrix powers

**Status:** READY TO INVESTIGATE on accepted `main`.

**Primary parents:**

- `LeanFrontier.LinearAlgebra.FibonacciMatrix`
- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.LucasNumber`

**Existing ingredients:**

- `trace_fibMatrix_pow_succ` gives the trace of a Q-matrix power as a Fibonacci sum;
- `lucas_succ_eq_fib_add_fib` identifies the same Fibonacci sum with a Lucas number;
- `det_fibMatrix_pow` gives determinant `(-1)^n`;
- Mathlib provides the `2 x 2` characteristic-polynomial formula in terms of trace and determinant.

**Preferred target:**

Do not stop at the trivial bridge `trace (fibMatrix^n) = lucas n`. Promote it into the structural statement

`charpoly (fibMatrix^n) = X^2 - C(lucas n) * X + C((-1)^n)`

with the necessary casts/indices stated cleanly.

**Why this is valuable:**

It identifies Lucas numbers as actual linear-algebraic invariants of Fibonacci evolution, not merely another Fibonacci rewrite. It also creates a useful interface for later eigenvalue, recurrence, determinant, and Binet-style work.

**Adversarial checks required:**

- index `n=0` and cast conventions over `Int`;
- sign/cast of `(-1)^n`;
- avoid merely restating a Mathlib theorem after rewriting;
- determine whether a trace-only lemma should be public scaffolding or private proof support.

**Current priority:** A.

---

### D. General Horadam companion matrix

**Status:** HIGH-VALUE INFRASTRUCTURE; investigate before implementing.

**Primary parents:**

- `LeanFrontier.NumberTheory.HoradamSequence`
- `LeanFrontier.LinearAlgebra.FibonacciMatrix`
- later `LucasNumber` as a natural consumer.

**Mathematical target:**

For the Horadam recurrence

`W(n+2) = P*W(n+1) - Q*W(n)`,

define the companion matrix

`A(P,Q) = [[P, -Q], [1, 0]]`.

For the fundamental sequence `U_n = W P Q 0 1 n`, prove an explicit power formula, e.g.

`A(P,Q)^(n+1) = [[U_(n+2), -Q*U_(n+1)], [U_(n+1), -Q*U_n]]`

over an appropriate commutative ring.

Then show that the existing Fibonacci Q-matrix is the specialization `A(1,-1)`.

**Why this is valuable:**

This creates an abstraction hub rather than a special-case bridge. It could support generalized Cassini identities, Lucas-like companion sequences, trace/determinant formulas, Chebyshev specializations, and later Binet-style results.

**Risks / design questions:**

- choose the coefficient type/general ring assumptions carefully;
- decide whether to reuse the existing `Horadam.W` directly or introduce a fundamental companion sequence namespace;
- avoid duplicating large Mathlib generic linear-recurrence infrastructure if an equivalent abstraction already exists;
- preserve the existing FibonacciMatrix API rather than replacing it merely for architectural neatness.

**Current priority:** A+, but larger than a normal bridge PR.

## 4. Audited directions — worthwhile but secondary

### E. Circular square/domino tilings counted by Lucas numbers

**Primary parents:** `FibonacciComposition` + `LucasNumber`.

Classically, linear square/domino tilings are Fibonacci-counted while circular tilings are Lucas-counted. A credible Lean development should define a genuine circular tiling object and decompose it by whether a domino crosses a chosen seam, reducing the cases to existing linear `oneTwoCompositions` counts.

Do not define the circular object artificially as the disjoint union whose cardinality is already the desired formula.

**Priority:** A-/B+.

---

### F. Explicit Prouhet power sums from Thue–Morse + PowerSums

**Primary parents:** `ThueMorse` + `PowerSums`.

The accepted Prouhet theorem gives equality of power sums between the two Thue–Morse classes. `PowerSums` can provide explicit total power sums, e.g. for cubes, so each equal half can be identified explicitly.

This is a genuine composition of two accepted modules, but its current downstream value is modest.

**Priority:** B.

---

### G. Maximum Stern-row value is Fibonacci

**Primary parent:** `SternDiatomic`; Fibonacci support would mainly come from Mathlib.

The classical extremal theorem says the maximum of Stern's sequence on an appropriate dyadic row/block is a Fibonacci number.

**Audit result:** mathematically excellent, but it is a weaker *LeanFrontier bridge* than first thought. The proof does not naturally need `FibonacciComposition`; rewriting the Fibonacci value as a composition cardinality would be decorative.

Treat it as a good independent Stern extension, not as a top corpus-synthesis target.

**Priority:** A as mathematics, B as a bridge.

## 5. Dependency-gated / long-term directions

### H. Stern diatomic / Calkin–Wilf to Stern–Brocot representation bridge

**Status:** REFORMULATED; high effort.

**Critical correction:**

Do not claim that increasing-index fractions

`fusc n / fusc (n+1)`

are simply the Stern–Brocot enumeration in the same order. They are naturally the Calkin–Wilf enumeration. Stern–Brocot contains the same positive rationals in a different tree/order.

A correct bridge should explicitly represent paths/tree nodes and prove the appropriate transformation (such as path/bit reversal) relating the Calkin–Wilf / Stern-diatomic indexing to Stern–Brocot mediant paths.

This likely requires new tree/path infrastructure before the final bridge theorem becomes clean.

**Priority:** A mathematical importance, high implementation cost.

---

### I. Markov tree to Farey / Stern–Brocot tree

**Status:** LONG-TERM; wait for #179 and additional Markov-tree infrastructure.

Classical theory identifies a combinatorial correspondence between the Markov tree and the Farey/Stern–Brocot tree, allowing Markov numbers/triples to be indexed by rational tree positions.

Likely prerequisites after #179:

- a durable Markov-tree/path representation;
- coordinate-permutation handling without theorem padding;
- proof that positive Markov triples descend to the root through the intended tree structure;
- a compatible Farey/Stern–Brocot path representation.

**Critical boundary:**

Do not claim that distinct rational tree positions necessarily yield distinct numerical Markov-number values. That risks crossing the classical Markov/Frobenius uniqueness conjecture boundary. A path-preserving/tree correspondence is the safe target.

**Priority:** A+, long-term.

---

### J. Markov Fibonacci branch

**Status:** FOLLOW-UP to a Markov/Farey tree correspondence.

Classically, a distinguished branch of the Markov tree produces odd-index Fibonacci Markov numbers. This is a worthwhile consequence once the tree/path framework exists.

Do not force this now merely because LeanFrontier contains Fibonacci modules; without the tree bridge it naturally depends on Mathlib's `Nat.fib`, not on a substantive LeanFrontier Fibonacci theorem.

**Priority:** later A-/B+.

---

### K. Descartes reflection and actual inversive geometry

**Status:** HOLD; current representations are too far apart.

`DescartesCircle` currently knows curvatures satisfying an algebraic equation. `InversiveGeometry` currently knows anti-Möbius reflection of points across a generalized circle in `ℂ`.

The genuine Apollonian geometric correspondence needs much more structure: oriented circles, centers/radii or curvature-center coordinates, tangency points/configurations, and the specific inversion/reflection that replaces one Descartes circle by the alternate completion.

Do not submit a theorem equating the existing two `reflect` functions merely because they share that name; they act on different mathematical objects and are not directly the same operation.

**Priority:** HOLD until representation infrastructure exists.

## 6. Directions deliberately not promoted

The following may be mathematically adjacent but currently lack a sufficiently useful bridge theorem:

- `Padovan` + `Tribonacci`: both fit higher-order linear-recurrence theory, but no compelling direct bridge is known yet;
- `FiniteGroupCharacter` + `ThueMorse`: a Boolean-cube character/Fourier viewpoint exists, but the current Thue–Morse theorem is already stronger than the obvious character-sum consequence;
- `LogisticMap` + `ThueMorse`: binary symbolic dynamics is related in spirit, but no current target clearly composes the accepted statements;
- folder-based bridges such as connecting `FibonacciReciprocal` to `Nesbitt` merely because both live under `Analysis` are not acceptable.

Keep isolated modules isolated until a real theorem justifies a connection.

## 7. Suggested sequencing while upstream PRs #179 and #180 wait

Do not flood upstream with additional PRs merely because candidates can be produced quickly. The present practical policy is to keep the two already-open upstream contributions as the temporary public ceiling while using the waiting time for deeper target work.

Recommended research/development order:

1. Design and scratch-check **Largest Ford circle between Farey neighbours** against accepted `main`.
2. Independently design the **Lucas characteristic polynomial of Q-matrix powers**; this does not depend on the two pending PRs.
3. Prototype the **general Horadam companion matrix** sufficiently to determine the right abstraction boundary, but do not rush it into a PR.
4. If PR #180 merges, re-evaluate and design the strong geometric **Ford–Farey–Descartes configuration** on the new `main`.
5. If PR #179 merges, begin designing the missing Markov-tree path/object layer before attempting the Markov/Farey correspondence.
6. Keep the Calkin–Wilf/Stern–Brocot representation bridge as a foundational research target; do not implement it until its precise path conventions are settled.

Any finished held candidate must be rebased/recreated and revalidated against current upstream `main` before eventual upstream submission if the baseline has moved.

## 8. Per-target research dossier format

Before implementation, create a concise dossier containing:

- exact proposed Lean theorem statement or API shape;
- accepted LeanFrontier prerequisites and exact declarations expected to be reused;
- mathematical source(s) and what they actually establish;
- Mathlib search results for equivalent or supporting theorems;
- intended downstream consumers;
- edge cases / degenerate inputs / sign or representation traps;
- expected proof difficulty and missing infrastructure;
- explicit reason the result is more than a graph-padding import edge;
- go / reformulate / reject decision.

Only after that dossier survives review should implementation begin.
