# Common ancestors in the canonical Markov/Stern-Brocot tree

LeanFrontier's accepted `sternNode` convention stores a path in reverse traversal order:
prepending a Boolean direction moves one edge farther from the root.  Consequently a path `p`
is an ancestor of a path `q` exactly when `p` is a suffix of `q`.

For later uniqueness arguments it is useful to have a canonical greatest common ancestor rather
than repeatedly unpacking suffix witnesses.  This module builds it in two stages.

First, `commonPrefix` is the ordinary longest common prefix of two Boolean lists and is
characterized by its universal property: it is a prefix of both lists, and every common prefix
is a prefix of it.  Reversing turns that into `commonAncestor`, the greatest common suffix in
the Stern-Brocot path convention.

The resulting API is purely combinatorial, but it is tailored to the accepted Markov tree:
`commonAncestor p q` is exactly the path of the deepest canonical node lying on both root-to-node
chains.

No Markov-number uniqueness statement is used or proved here.
