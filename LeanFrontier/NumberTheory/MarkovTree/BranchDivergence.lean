# First divergence below a common Markov-tree ancestor

The accepted `commonAncestor` API identifies the deepest path shared by two canonical
Stern-Brocot nodes.  This module adds the next structural step needed for later Markov-number
collision arguments: incomparable paths necessarily leave their deepest common ancestor through
different immediate children.

Because LeanFrontier's `sternNode` convention moves away from the root by prepending directions,
a descendant of the child `dir :: a` has the form

`tail ++ dir :: a`.

The main theorem packages the exact equivalence:

two paths are incomparable in the ancestor/suffix order iff they admit decompositions below
`commonAncestor p q` with different first child directions.

This is still purely tree combinatorics.  No Markov-number equality or uniqueness statement is
used.
