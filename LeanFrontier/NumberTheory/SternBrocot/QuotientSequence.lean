# Euclidean quotient sequences of Stern-Brocot paths

A single maximal Stern-Brocot run is already known to record one Euclidean quotient. This module
iterates that arithmetic statement across a whole path.

The function `euclideanRunQuotients` is the symmetric Euclidean algorithm on a positive pair: at
each step it divides the larger coordinate by the smaller and recurses on the remainder. Thus it
omits the conventional leading zero for a rational below one; that zero can be restored later when
identifying these quotients with regular continued-fraction coefficients.

The function `pathQuotients` recursively peels the accepted canonical initial run of a
Stern-Brocot path. Nonterminal runs contribute their length, while the terminal run contributes
one more than its length, exactly matching the endpoint convention already proved in
`initialRun_euclidean_step`.

The main theorem identifies these two complete quotient sequences.
